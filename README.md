# Tips_Dataset_LR
Predicting tips using Linear Regression Model

EDA Insights: Utilizes pair plots to visualize relationships between numerical variables (total_bill, tip) across genders (sex). Box plots further illustrate how total_bill and tip vary by day of the week (day), offering insights into spending and tipping patterns.

Model Development: Implements LinearRegression for predicting tip amounts from total_bill, incorporating hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV to optimize model performance based on mean squared error.

Model Performance: Evaluates the best model's accuracy using mean squared error metrics on a test set, demonstrating effectiveness in predicting tips based on total bill amounts.

Practical Application: Offers a practical example of predicting tips (tip) for a given total_bill, enhancing understanding of how restaurant bills influence tipping behavior.

Visualization Impact: Employs matplotlib and seaborn for visual representations, aiding in data exploration and model interpretation, crucial for developing robust insights into tipping behavior.
